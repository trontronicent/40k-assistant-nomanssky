# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-03

- **Live data from the running game (read-only):** while No Man's Sky runs,
  the plugin reads the planets of the system you are in from the game's
  memory - name, type, weather, the three resources and plant resource, flora,
  fauna and sentinels (for your combat setting) - and remembers every planet
  it sees (`planet_history.json`). It also knows which system and planet you
  are on right now.
- **Visited systems:** every system in the save's visit list and discoveries,
  with uploaded system and planet names, plus the recorded planets with their
  resources.
- New permission `read-game-memory`; needs the 40k Assistant 3.2.0.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-03

- Inventories show each item's name in English and in the language the game
  runs in (Steam's language setting), plus the game's own icon. Names and
  icons are read from the installed game's files (`GAMEDATA/PCBANKS/*.pak`),
  cached per game build, and re-read automatically after a game update
  (*Re-read item names* does it on demand).
- Needs the 40k Assistant 3.1.0 (icon cells in plugin views, the `zstandard`
  package for the game's archives).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-03

- First version: save-file connector (status, location with portal address,
  inventories, ships, bases, fleet) and a log of every save write.
